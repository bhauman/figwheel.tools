# figwheel.tools

Figwheel tools will eventually hold much of Figwheels functionality in
separate composable libraries, (i.e. compile, error/warning parsing etc.)

Right now, it only holds the parts for `figwheel.tools.nrepl` which is a drop in
replacement for [piggieback](https://github.com/cemerick/piggieback).

`piggieback` has one known flaw, it recreates a new CLJS repl on each
request. Creating a CLJS REPL is a particularly heavy operation
involving at least the reloading of the analysis cache. This causes a
noticable lag on each evaluation.

`figwheel.tools.nrepl` creates a single REPL on a thread and is much
more responsive and lighter as a result. It also handles more of the nREPL
protocol's features.

For example it can handle mutiple forms
```
;; Multiple forms are evaluated:
=> 1 2 (+ 1 2) 4
1
2
3
4
=>
```

You can also `interrupt` a hung evaluation:
```
;; Interrupting a hung evaluation
=> (loop [] (recur))
;; now reload the current page that hosts the REPL
^C
;; control is returned to the REPL which is actually running in 
;; a new runtime
=>
```

`figwheel.tools.nrepl` handles the ClojureScript I/O as explicit
messages and can leverage these explicit messages to create a better
ClojureScript nREPL experience.

## Usage

Modify your project.clj to include the following :dependencies and :repl-options:

```
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[figwheel.tools "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
                                [org.clojure/tools.nrepl "0.2.12"]]
                 :repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [figwheel.tools.nrepl/wrap-cljs-repl]}}}
```

In you nREPL environment you can now start a CLJS REPL


```
$ lein repl
....
user=> (figwheel.tools.nrepl/cljs-repl (cljs.repl.rhino/repl-env))
To quit, type: :cljs/quit
nil
cljs.user=> (defn <3 [a b] (str a " <3 " b "!"))
#<
function cljs$user$_LT_3(a, b) {
    return [cljs.core.str(a), cljs.core.str(" <3 "), cljs.core.str(b), cljs.core.str("!")].join("");
}
>
cljs.user=> (<3 "nREPL" "ClojureScript")
"nREPL <3 ClojureScript!"
```
